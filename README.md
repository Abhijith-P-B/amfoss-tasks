## INTRODUCTION
Hi, I'm Abhijith P, a first-year B.Tech CSE (AI) student at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri. I have a Basic knowledge in 
Python and MySQL from my high school, and I’m currently learning C to deepen my understanding of programming
fundamentals.My hobbies include playing football and video games.

## Why should we choose you ?
I'm really excited about the chance to be part of AMFOSS. I probably might not be knowing everything yet, but I am a guy who
can learn fast and I’m someone you can count on :) disciplined, consistent, and always ready to put in the work
especially when it comes to learning and working with others and would always try my best on whatever I face.

## How do you intend to contribute back to the club
As time passes and as my knowledge in different fields of tech increases, I want to support others the same way I was helped
by guiding new members, contributing to club projects,trying to win in hackathons and being an active, reliable part of 
events and workshops(which has helped alot in my case).I’m here to learn, contribute, and be someone the club can count on.

## What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them ?
I’m interested in alot of fields, I love playing football and im also very much interested in learning more about Software 
Devolopment/Game Devolopment.
To keep improving, I plan to take on challenges such as joining hackathons (which I took an initiative by taking part in the
upcoming SIH)solving plenty of problems from platforms such as Codechef,Codeforce and actively contribute to open source
projects to improve my coding skills and logical thinking.I strongly believe that experience is the best way to learn, 
and I’m excited to keep pushing myself in these areas.
