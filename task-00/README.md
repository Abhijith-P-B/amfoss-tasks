# Task-00 (Install Linux)
$ Successfully installed the latest version of Ubuntu in my laptop.

$ That was very interesting to do as it had been the first time installing an Operating system on my own.

$ There occured many issues too, the os got crashed and wouldnt load to Ubuntu. But I could solve the issue by the info I learned from yt.
