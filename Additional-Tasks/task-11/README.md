# SUMMARY
$ Cleared 15 levels of Bandit on OverTheWire Bandit.

$ Learned alot of commands used in terminal.(I found decompressing files as one of the most useful thing I learnt)

$ Had fun discovering newer methods to find passwords for each level.

$ Used key commands like : ls , cd ,grep ,file ,cat ,ssh ,openss1 ,tar ,bzip ,gzip.

$ Have attatched the password and details of code used.
